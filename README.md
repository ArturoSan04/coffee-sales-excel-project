# coffee-sales-excel-project
In this Excel project, coffee data was pulled from a sample dataset, and with the given data Xlookup functions were used to populate additional columns to the table. The columns that were populated were:
  - Customer name
  - Email
  - Country
  - Coffee Type
  - Roast Type
  - Size
  - Unite Price
  - Sales

Additionally, Coffee Type Name, Roast Type Name, and Loyalty Card were columns added to the table.

After organizing the data, pivot tables were generated on separate sheets to construct the ultimate dashboard visible on the last sheet. This interactive dashboard facilitates efficient data exploration, enabling users to precisely retrieve the desired information.

I have also added the original dataset file before adding the additional columns to see the work that has been done.
